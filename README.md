# mcp-abap-adt

This is an MCP server (work in progress) to enable large language models to work with SAP ABAP using ADT, wrapping multiple REST endpoints into simple-to-use tools.

## Features

- Retrieve ABAP program source code
- Get ABAP program properties
- Verbose logging for better debugging and monitoring

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   SAP_URL=https://your-sap-server-url:port
   SAP_USERNAME=your_username
   SAP_PASSWORD=your_password
   SAP_CLIENT=your_client_number
   ```
   Replace the values with your SAP system details.

4. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

5. Run the server:
   ```
   node dist/index.js
   ```

## Usage

The server provides the following main tools:

1. `get_program_source`: Retrieve the source code of an ABAP program
2. `get_program_properties`: Retrieve properties of an ABAP program

These tools can be accessed through the MCP protocol.

## Logging

The server now includes verbose logging, which provides detailed information about:

- Server startup and initialization
- Configuration loading
- Request handling
- API calls to SAP system
- Error messages

Logs are output to the console, making it easier to debug and monitor the server's operation.
